\title{Identify the first two local maxima and the minimum ("valley") between them in a density estimate}
\usage{
get_mode_antimode(x, bw_adjust = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector from which to estimate a density.}

\item{bw_adjust}{A numeric multiplier for the bandwidth. The bandwidth is chosen via the "SJ" method and
then multiplied by \code{bw_adjust}.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\describe{
\item{mode}{The x-value of the first local maximum (peak).}
\item{antimode}{The x-value of the local minimum (valley) between the first two peaks.}
\item{pdf}{A function that interpolates (and extrapolates) the estimated density at arbitrary points.}
}
}
\description{
This function estimates the density of a numeric vector \code{x}, identifies the first two local maxima
(peaks), and locates the lowest point (valley) between those peaks. It returns the x-values for the
first peak (mode), the valley (antimode), and a function for interpolating the estimated PDF.
