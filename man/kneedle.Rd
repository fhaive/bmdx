\title{Identify the knee point in two vectors using a simple Kneedle-like approach}
\usage{
kneedle(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the x-coordinates.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector representing the y-coordinates.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{index}}{The index of the knee point in the original vectors.}
\item{\code{x}}{The x-value at the knee point.}
\item{\code{y}}{The y-value at the knee point.}
}
}
\description{
This function normalizes the input vectors \code{x} and \code{y} to the range [0, 1]
and calculates the difference \code{(y_norm - x_norm)} at each point. The maximum
of this difference is used as the index of the knee point, and the corresponding
values of \code{x} and \code{y} at this index are returned.
}
\details{
The vectors \code{x} and \code{y} are first normalized to the [0, 1] range.
The function then computes the difference \code{(y_norm - x_norm)} at each
corresponding index and identifies the knee point as the location where this
difference is maximized.
