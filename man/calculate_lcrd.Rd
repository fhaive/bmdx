\title{Calculate the Lowest Consistent Response Dose (LCRD)}
\usage{
calculate_lcrd(pod_vector, ratio_threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{pod_vector}{A numeric vector of BMC values.}

\item{ratio_threshold}{The maximum allowed ratio between consecutive BMCs (default: 1.66).}
}
\value{
A list containing the LCRD, the CRGB (consistent response group of BMCs), and the ranked BMCs.
}
\description{
This function identifies the lowest consistent response dose (LCRD) from a numeric vector of BMC values.
The BMCs are ranked in ascending order, and a consistency check is applied such that the ratio
between consecutive BMCs (BMC\link{n+1} / BMC\link{n}) must be < 1.66. The first BMC for which all subsequent
ratios remain below this threshold is declared the LCRD.
