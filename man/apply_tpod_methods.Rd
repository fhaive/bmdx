\usage{
apply_tpod_methods(
  model_stats,
  tpod_methods_list = c("percentile", "mean", "first_mode", "lowest", "accumulation"),
  pod_value = "BMD",
  percentile = 0.95,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_stats}{A data frame containing model statistics used for tPOD computation.}

\item{tpod_methods_list}{Character vector; methods to apply, options include "percentile", "mean", "first_mode", "lowest", "accumulation".}

\item{pod_value}{Character; type of point of departure to use: "BMD", "BMDL", or "BMDU". Default is "BMD".}

\item{percentile}{Numeric; a value between 0 and 1 indicating the target percentile. Default is 0.95.}

\item{lowest_method}{Character; method for selecting the lowest value: "lowest" or "LCRD". Default is "lowest".}

\item{bw_adjust}{Numeric; bandwidth adjustment for density estimation methods. Default is 3.}

\item{robust}{Logical; whether to use robust statistics where applicable. Default is FALSE.}

\item{plot}{Logical; whether to generate plots during tPOD computation. Default is FALSE.}

\item{ratio_threshold}{Numeric; threshold for ratio-based decisions. Default is 1.66.}

\item{rank}{Numeric; rank selection for the tPOD if multiple candidates exist. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the computed tPOD values with columns: "Method", "Parameter", and "tPOD".
}
\description{
This function computes the tPOD (toxicological point of departure) using various methods
and returns a data frame with the computed values. Errors during computation are handled gracefully,
with NA returned for failed calculations.
